abstract = {Over the last years, particle filters have been applied$\backslash$nwith great success to a variety of state estimation$\backslash$nproblems. We present a statistical approach to increasing$\backslash$nthe efficiency of particle filters by adapting the size of$\backslash$nsample sets on-the-fly. The key idea of the KLD-sampling$\backslash$nmethod is to bound the approximation error introduced by$\backslash$nthe sample-based representation of the particle filter. The$\backslash$nname KLD-sampling is due to the fact that we measure the$\backslash$napproximation error by the Kullback-Leibler distance. Our$\backslash$nadaptation approach chooses a small number of samples if$\backslash$nthe density is focused on a small part of the state space,$\backslash$nand it chooses a large number of samples if the state$\backslash$nuncertainty is high. Both the implementation and$\backslash$ncomputation overhead of this approach are small. Extensive$\backslash$nexperiments using mobile robot localization as a test$\backslash$napplication show that our approach yields drastic$\backslash$nimprovements over particle filters with fixed sample set$\backslash$nsizes and over a previously introduced adaptation$\backslash$ntechnique.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
